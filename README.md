# Tenis
Tenis minigame in c++.

Proyect done in FP1 during my first year at university.
Consists of a tenis simulator minigame with 2 modes: automatic (where balls are thrown at random) or manual (where two players can compete taking turns). Also there's a debug mode where the random numbers generated are shown to better explain the development of the match.
The "tenistas.txt" file just acts as a savefile for the players data (ability, speed, wins and losses). Check the savefile route before executing (make sure the relative route is right).
